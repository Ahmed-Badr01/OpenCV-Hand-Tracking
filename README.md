# OpenCV Hand Tracking

This repository contains a hand tracking class written using OpenCV and Mediapipe [HandTrackingModule.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/HandTrackingModule.py), as well as some mini applications that were built using it.

All scripts were written from scratch following the videos linked below, **except for [HandTrackingModule.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/HandTrackingModule.py), for which I `copied` the original code and then reformatted it.**

All scripts in this repository (with the exception of [Snake Game.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/Snake%20Game.py) were made following __sections__ from the following tutorial: [Advanced Computer Vision with Python - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY).

- [Hand Volume Control.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/Hand%20Volume%20Control.py) covers the time between [2:52:10](https://youtu.be/01sAkU_NvOY?t=10330) and [3:27:45](https://youtu.be/01sAkU_NvOY?t=12465)
- [Finger Counter.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/Finger%20Counter.py)) covers the time between [3:27:45](https://youtu.be/01sAkU_NvOY?t=12465) and [4:05:43](https://youtu.be/01sAkU_NvOY?t=14743)
- [Virtual Mouse.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/Virtual%20Mouse.py)) covers the time between [6:01:26](https://youtu.be/01sAkU_NvOY?t=21686) and goes until the end of the video.

The script [Snake Game.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/Snake%20Game.py) was made following the [Snake Game using Opencv Python + 3080 Ti Giveaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26Ze6lP02Y) video by [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI](https://www.youtube.com/@murtazasworkshop).
