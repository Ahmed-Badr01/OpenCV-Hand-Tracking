# OpenCV Hand Tracking

This repository contains a hand tracking class written using OpenCV and Mediapipe [HandTrackingModule.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/HandTrackingModule.py), as well as some mini applications that were built using it.

All scripts in this repository (with the exception of [Snake Game.py](https://github.com/Ahmed-Badr01/OpenCV-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/Snake%20Game.py) were made following __sections__ from the following tutorial: [Advanced Computer Vision with Python - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY).
